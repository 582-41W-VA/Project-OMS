# Request for Proposal: Order Management System

**Introduction:**
Our company is seeking proposals for the implementation of a new Order Management System (OMS) to streamline our workflow and enhance efficiency. As a small business operating both a physical store and an online platform, we are dedicated to providing exceptional customer service and timely order fulfillment.

**Background:**
Currently, our order processing system involves manual consolidation of orders received from three different sources: in-store purchases, online orders through our website, and requests via our Facebook page. This manual process has led to issues with order prioritization and allocation, resulting in delays and customer dissatisfaction.

**Objectives:**
- Implement an automated OMS to consolidate orders from various channels.
- Prioritize orders based on date and customizations, ensuring timely fulfillment.
- Improve communication and coordination between departments (sales, production, inventory, and shipping).
- Enhance overall productivity and customer satisfaction.

**Scope of Work:**
The selected vendor will be responsible for:
- Designing and deploying an OMS tailored to our specific needs.
- Integrating order gathering from our physical store, website, and Facebook page.
- Implementing prioritization algorithms to manage order flow efficiently.
- Providing user-friendly interfaces for order management and progress tracking.
- Developing notification systems for order status updates and delays.
- Creating reporting functionalities for monitoring order status by department and employee.

**Requirements:**
The OMS should include:
- Order entry capabilities with assignment options for departments or employees.
- Sorting and management features for employees to update order progress.
- Notifications for impending delays to prioritize critical orders.
- Reporting tools for tracking order status and performance metrics.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Proposals will be evaluated based on:
- Understanding of our business requirements.
- Technical capabilities and customization options.
- User interface intuitiveness and ease of use.
- Implementation timeline and support services.
- Cost-effectiveness and scalability.

**Budget:**
Our budget for this project is flexible and will be discussed during vendor negotiations. We are looking for cost-effective solutions that align with our business needs.

**Submission Instructions:**

**Terms and Conditions:**
